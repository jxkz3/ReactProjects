      <h1>Hi, I’m Jasik</h1>
      <p>
        I started in web security, hunting bugs on real platforms. Now I build
        React apps, learning by breaking things and fixing them. I focus on
        websites that just work and understanding how every piece connects under
        the hood. I’m also learning backend development to level up as a
        full-stack developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I get obsessed with learning and figuring out why
        something “should work” but doesn’t.
      </p>
    </div>
